# Getting Started

Welcome to Lemme! ðŸŽ‰

Lemme makes it easy to create beautiful documentation for your Laravel projects. You've just installed it, and now you can start creating your own docs.

## How It Works

Lemme works by reading Markdown files from your `docs/` directory and presenting them in a clean, navigable interface. You can organize your content using directories, and even use number prefixes to control the order.

## Writing Your First Page

1. Create a new `.md` file in your `docs/` directory
2. Write your content using Markdown syntax
3. Visit your docs in the browser to see it live

## Example Structure

```
docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.md                    # Homepage
â”œâ”€â”€ 1_welcome/                  # Grouped section
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 1_getting-started.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 2_organizing-content.md
â””â”€â”€ changelog.md               # Standalone page
```
